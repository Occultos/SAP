Description: # BaseHash
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bnlucas/python-basehash.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bnlucas/python-basehash)
        
        BaseHash is a small library for creating reversible obfuscated identifier hashes
        to a given base and length. The project is based on the GO library, [PseudoCrypt][pc]
        by [Kevin Burns][kb]. The library is extendible to use custom alphabets and other
        bases.
        
        The library uses golden primes and the [Baillie-PSW][bp] primality test or the
        `gmpy2.is_prime` (if available) for hashing to `maximum` length (`base ** length - 1`).
        
        ## v3.0.5
        
        A massive overhaul was done with the primality algorithms. Including support for
        [gmpy2][gmp] if it available on the system for that much more of an increase.
        
        All methods being used to check primality in `primes.py` have been optimized and
        benchmarked to try to get the best possible preformance when `gmpy2.is_prime`
        and `gmpy2.next_prime` are not available.
