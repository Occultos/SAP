Use this to jot down TODOs and ideas [whether or not we will add them]

#######################################################################

retroactively add unknown barcode item amount scanned after it is
	assigned to a food
		(one list that holds both the barcode and the scan amount one index over)?
		(set both then remove both on use)


create new item screen can use barcode scanner directly to add a new 
	barcode if barcode does not already exist 


ADMIN email could have a listbox of known "food partners" email, so the admin will just select one and it
	populate the 'enter email address' entry box, so they dont need to type it in, but they 
	still can if they want


log folder sharable throughout the local network (as read only)

auto send email daily/ and or on low?
